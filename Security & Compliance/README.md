# Security & Compliance


## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** defines how security and compliance responsibilities are distributed between AWS and the customer.

---

## üîê Core Principle

| Responsibility Area       | Who‚Äôs Responsible |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Security of the Cloud** | **AWS** ‚Äì responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services |
| **Security in the Cloud** | **Customer** ‚Äì responsible for securing data, configurations, identity, and applications |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Shared Controls

Some security and compliance responsibilities are shared between AWS and the customer:

- **Patch Management** ‚Äì AWS patches infrastructure; customers patch OS/applications
- **Configuration Management** ‚Äì AWS provides secure defaults; customers configure to meet business needs
- **Awareness & Training** ‚Äì AWS maintains secure operations; customers train users on secure usage

---

## üîÑ Shared Responsibility Categories

| Aspect                   | AWS Responsibility                                 | Customer Responsibility |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Infrastructure**       | Physical security, hardware, and global network    | Not applicable |
| **Configuration**        | Default service configurations                     | Customize to meet security needs |
| **Data Protection**      | Provide encryption tools and capabilities          | Implement encryption and manage access |
| **Patching**             | Infrastructure-level patches                       | OS and application-level patches |
| **Access Management**    | Provide IAM services                               | Define and manage IAM policies and permissions |

## Data at rest vs. Data in transit

At rest: data stored or archived on a device  
On a hard disk, on a RDS instance, in S3 Glacier Deep Archive, etc.  
In transit (in motion): data being moved from one location to another  
Transfer from on-premises to AWS, EC2 to DynamoDB, etc.  
Means data transferred on the network  
We want to encrypt data in both states to protect it!  
For this we leverage encryption keys  

## AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

Anytime you hear ‚Äúencryption‚Äù for an AWS service, it‚Äôs most likely KMS  
KMS = AWS manages the encryption keys for us  

### Encryption Opt-in:

EBS volumes: encrypt volumes  
S3 buckets: Server-side encryption of objects  
Redshift database: encryption of data  
RDS database: encryption of data
